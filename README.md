# Diary Application for Android

Welcome to my project! I am building a beautiful Diary application leveraging the latest APIs and technologies in Android Development. My goal is to create an intuitive and user-friendly diary app that ensures your memories and thoughts are stored securely and beautifully.
I am nearing the end of my internship and have learnt a lot about the best Android development practices and wanted to practice building an app with the latest technologies (Especially Jetpack compose) to show my skills. 

## Features

- **Jetpack Compose UI:** Utilize Jetpack Compose for building a modern, fully declarative UI for Android that simplifies and accelerates UI development.
- **ROOM Library:** Implement a robust local database using the ROOM library for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **New Splash API & Material 3:** Adopt the latest Splash API and Material 3 design for a sleek, responsive user interface.
- **Kotlin Coroutines:** Employ Kotlin Coroutines for managing background tasks with simplified code and improved app performance.
- **Dagger-Hilt:** Utilize Dagger-Hilt for dependency injection, enhancing the scalability, maintainability, and testing of our application.
- **One-Tap Sign-In with Google & Firebase Authentication:** Integrate seamless authentication mechanisms with One-Tap Sign-In with Google and Firebase Authentication.
- **Firebase Storage & Mongo Authentication:** Leverage Firebase Storage for media files and Mongo Authentication for secure access control.
- **Mongo Realm Database & Device Sync:** Utilize Mongo Realm Database for a flexible, scalable database solution and Device Sync for real-time, bi-directional data synchronization between the client and server.
  
## Real-Time Collaboration and Offline Support

My application stands out by offering:
- **Offline Functionality:** With Device Sync, changes made offline are saved locally and automatically synced with the backend once an internet connection is reestablished, ensuring seamless user experiences.
- **Real-Time Collaboration:** Enable real-time collaboration features, allowing users to interact and share diary entries effortlessly.
- **Minimal Effort Industry-Ready Apps:** Building with Mongo Device Sync enables you to create industry-ready applications with minimal effort, thanks to out-of-the-box networking code and automatic conflict resolution.
